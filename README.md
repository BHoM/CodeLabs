## 📋 About Code Labs
Code Labs is our monthly drop-in program designed to build a network of computational champions across our global offices. We connect regional innovation with centralized development processes through the BHoM framework.

## 🎯 Mission
Transform individual computational curiosity into collaborative regional communities that contribute to our global development pipeline.

## 📅 Getting Started
1. Review the [live presentation](https://BHoM.github.io/CodeLabs/)
2. Schedule your regional Code Labs session
3. Recruit 2-3 computational champions
4. Prepare 1-2 DevDocs opportunities
5. Join the next global sync session

## 🤝 Contributing
This repository serves as the central hub for Code Labs resources. Regional leaders can contribute by:
- Submitting DevDocs templates and examples
- Sharing regional success stories
- Contributing to documentation improvements
